      'title': 'Independence & Respect',
      'text': 'FROM MY HEART - Barbara Gonzalez-Ventura (The Philippine Star) - June 14, 2020 - 12:00am\nSince Independence Day, I have wondered exactly what the word “independence” means. I have always thought of myself as an independent woman who became a working single parent who raised her children somewhat haphazardly, but there were times when we had a lot of fun. So I looked up the word “independent” on Google. I can use Google, meaning I’m a bit of a techie, even if I don’t score well on the shopping sites. “Independent” means free from outside control; not depending on another’s authority.\nWhen I think about it, now that I have been retired for about a thousand years, I don’t think I agree about not depending on another’s authority. I left the authority of a parent when I married, discovered the undecipherable authority of a husband, could not accept that and left it only to accept the authority of bosses.\nBut there were limits to their authority as well. I remember my first job in advertising. My immediate boss was wonderful and so was our SuperBoss — let’s call the president of the company that — who was very melodramatic. I don’t know how long I had been working there, long enough for all of us to have become good friends. We were having a brainstorming meeting. Brainstorming is what you do when you’re trying to think of a new creative campaign.\nThe president already had an idea. The rest of us were trying to come up with something else. I was saying something when a folder of old ads landed with a thud right in front of me. He had thrown it. “Look at that,” he said in what I called his loud Shakespearean tones. “Look at it!”\nI cast a glance at the folder, thinking: He threw you at me. That is a total lack of respect. Without saying a word I picked up my notebook, ballpoint pen, handbag, walked out of the room and took a cab home. He had insulted me. I knew I was three rungs below him, but he had no right to throw anything at me.\nI went home and didn’t go to work the next day. My immediate boss called me and asked me to come to work. “No,” I said. “I feel very disrespected and insulted. Nobody throws a folder at me. I’m taking time off to think about what I want to do.” “What do you mean?” my immediate boss asked. “Are you going to resign?”“Maybe,” I said.\nThe next day SuperBoss himself came to the house, apologized to me and convinced me to come back to work. I did. No one ever threw a folder at me again. Was that a sign of independence or was it just pride? Later on when I hit my 50s and attended seminars on the teachings of Carl Jung I realized that SuperBoss had crossed one of my boundaries. That boundary I call respect. One of the lessons I have learned in life is the value of respect — for ourselves and for others.\nWhat does that really mean? I think it means thinking about other people’s feelings before acting. It takes a lot of training to do that because showing respect requires quick thinking. Before he threw the folder, which to him was just a dramatic gesture, he should have thought: How would I feel if someone threw a folder that landed right in front of me? I would think it was thrown at me. I would be insulted. If that’s how I would feel, then I should probably just ask the other people between us to pass the folder to her.\nBut that takes time to think out. The best way to show respect is to learn it as a child from the example of your parents, from their teaching, from your experiences at school with the nuns, from your experiences at work. As you grow older, depending on the observations you make and how profoundly you absorb them, showing respect becomes instinctive. It has become such a part of you.\nLike my husband and me. He likes Trump. I don’t. So we don’t watch TV together. Sometimes when I hear him watching Anderson Cooper on CNN I join him for a while because I like Anderson’s views. But he doesn’t and he often changes channels quickly so I let him. I just watch Anderson in the bedroom. I respect how he likes Trump and he respects how I dislike him. We live in peace.\nBut all these insights on independence and respect come to me late in life. I learned it as I lived through observation and making mistakes of my own. I don’t think I ever taught it to my children in this way. I hope and pray I taught it by example though I fear I might have failed. But I write this now just to share, maybe to help. * * * ',

      'text': '5 Android apps you shouldn’t miss this week! – Android Apps Weekly 29 Joe Hindy / @ThatJoeHindy\nWelcome to the 322nd edition of Android Apps Weekly . Here are the big headlines from the last week: The FBI released a statement this week regarding a rise in bank fraud. The two major concerns are on-device trojans and fraudulent banking apps. The on-device trojans are the bigger worry since it can emulate the login page on banking websites. The fraudulent apps are just clones of existing banking apps and you shouldn’t see those if you stick to the Play Store. In any case, make sure you have two-factor authentication turned on and stay vigilant. You should be fine. WhatsApp is working for better storage management for its users. One of the new features is an improved message search by date. You simply search for a date and WhatsApp shows you messages from that date. Future updates may include the ability to filter messages by forwarded files and other media. The message by date search is rolling out now. The rest may come in a future update. Fitbit devices may get Google Assistant soon. An APK teardown showed some code with instructions no how to active Google Assistant in the Fitbit app. It’s very similar to the Fitbit Versa 2 ‘s ability to use Amazon Alexa so this may start on that tracker. We don’t know when or if this becomes a reality, but it’s a possibility. Another way to block YouTube ads made its way out this week. Apparently, adding a period to part of the URL magically blocks most of the ads on the site. The symbol apparently breaks some things on the site and simply doesn’t let the advertising through. It’s not as effective as some ad blockers, but it’s a neat little tidbit. Hit the link to see examples of how it works. The long awaited Google Play Music to YouTube Music transfer tool is finally rolling out. We first talked about this weeks ago as Google begins to wind down Google Play Music. The tool lets you transfer your playlists and other data from one account to the other. The transfer tool is a one click process so it shouldn’t take long to get everything switched over. It’s rolling out in waves so it may take a bit for it to actually get to you. The Farm: Sassy Princess\nPrice: Free to play\nThe Farm: Sassy Princess is a new farming simulator. Players can plant crops, start a family, and do a bunch of other smaller things. It’s not quite as deep as some farming sims we’ve tried. There are some saving graces, though. For instance, you can combo together crops you grow for higher yields and there are a variety of side quests to keep things fresh. There are some basic ideas here that are a little old and tired plus the free to play elements are a little annoying after a while. Still, it’s a decent little time killer if you’re into this sort of thing. Split Apps\nPrice: $1.49\nSplit Apps is an Android productivity tool with a simple premise. It lets you take two apps and create a shortcut on the home screen. When you tap on it, it opens both apps in multi-window mode. There isn’t a lot to talk about with this one. You open the app, select two apps, and the app puts an icon on the home screen that opens both of them at once. That’s all it does. Not all apps or devices support multi-window mode so of course this won’t work for everything, but it seemed to work fine in our testing. The app runs for $1.49 with no in-app purchases. Small Town Murders\nPrice: Free to play\nSmall Town Murders is a mix between a match-three game and a mystery game. You play the role of an investigator in an allegedly peaceful hamlet. You find clues, solve puzzles, and figure out all of the crimes. The game contains a metric ton of levels as you would expect from any match-three game. The graphics are colorful and fun, but despite its kid-friendly looks, the content isn’t the most suitable for kids. The game has a tendency to drag on a bit and you have to solve a lot of puzzles to move the story forward. Otherwise, it’s a decent time waster. Adobe Photoshop Camera\nPrice: Free\nAdobe Photoshop Camera is a new camera app from Adobe. At its core, it’s a simple camera app with some filter effects. However, those photo effects are actually pretty good. You can apply filters real-time before snapping the photo or after the photo is taken. There are some really interesting ones as well. Some additional features include portrait mode controls along with creator-inspired filters. It’s a silly cross-over but the camera app works as advertised. Its biggest issue is device availability. It’s available on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus, but not my Pixel 3a or my LG V60. My Talking Tom Friends\nPrice: Free to play\nMy Talking Tom Friends is the latest game from Outfit7, developers of the popular My Talking Tom franchise. This one follows the same themes from previous games and brings back characters from each one. There are a bunch of kid-friendly mini-games and activities to play, but there are some adults who say they enjoy it as well. Additionally, there is a heavy customization element. The advertising is a little much for a kids game, but it’s otherwise relatively harmless.',

      'title': 'PUBG x Stadia: Interview with Joon Choi, PUBG Console Lead',
      'text': 'PUBG Corp.\nWhat makes the PUBG x Stadia partnership special? PUBG Corp. and Stadia have teamed up to bring the iconic Battle Royale experience to an all-new player base on Google’s new gaming platform. The announcement was made last month that PUBG would be available to Stadia players along with exclusive PUBG x Stadia skin sets for those who purchased one of three game bundles.\nPUBG Corp.\nStadia’s cloud-based gaming experience allows players to enjoy PUBG from anywhere at any time, whether it’s on a mobile device or a big-screen TV. Those playing on Stadia will have the option to queue up in Cross-Platform parties, bringing together PUBG’s Console community like never before. The addition of a new platform doesn’t just bring the title to new players, it brings new teammates and opponents to those already on console with PlayStation and XBOX.\nThe announcement of this partnership is an exciting one, so for more insight into what his means for the community, what players have to look forward to, and makes this news special, we asked the PUBG Console Lead, Joon Choi, a few questions.\nApp Trigger: What would you say is the most exciting aspect of PUBG coming to new players on Google Stadia?\nJoon Choi, PUBG Console Lead: We’re looking forward to reaching a wider audience, with new and returning players who can experience the game on a new platform. There is a lot of great crossovers there. For those that haven’t played PUBG, they can experience our unique Battle Royale that has immersive gameplay and some of the best gunplay on the market. For returning players, they have the opportunity to experience a new cloud gaming platform and the unique conveniences that come with that.\nApp Trigger: What do you believe players on Google Stadia should be most excited to experience for themselves?\nJoon Choi: The convenience factor is definitely exciting. Since Stadia is cloud-based, you can play instantly across multiple devices…from your TV, to your PC, to your tablets, and mobile devices. That opens up a lot of possibilities. Outside of that, it’s a great way for first time PUBG players to experience the game or another great way to play if you’re gaming on PC or console already.\nApp Trigger: How does the partnership between PUBG x Stadia set itself apart from other current platforms?\nJoon Choi: We have a great working relationship with all our first-party platform partners. Google has been really great to work with, in addition to being a tremendous help from the very beginning. In addition to giving us the right tools to work with, they provided lots of great engineer advice as well.\nPUBG Corp.\nAT: Cross-platform play and cloud-based gaming provide ease of access to players on the Google Stadia, what else can players look forward to in regards to gearing up and playing with friends?\nJC: To your point, players can jump in and squad up with their friends on console through full cross-party play. Outside of that, players can look forward to putting their squad of friends against others in our recently released Ranked Mode. Our players have requested a way to measure skill for years, so we’re really happy to be able to finally provide that.\nMore from App and Gaming News PlayStation 5: Five best-looking PS5 games revealed so far BugSnax was possibly the weirdest and most interesting PS5 game revealed Project Athia: Square Enix’s working title won the PS5 reveal event NBA 2K21: First look at next-gen sweat on PS5 Goodbye Volcano High brings much-needed diversity to PS5 AT: What does the addition of a primarily new player base on Google Stadia mean for the console community at large?\nJC: From an industry and developer perspective, a larger player base (new or returning) is always a great thing. It means more people are being exposed to gaming, and specifically for us, more people are given the chance to play PUBG. In addition to that, new and existing PUBG gamers have more options to choose an experience that speaks to them.\nAT: Is there anything else you’d like the players on Google Stadia, or perhaps new players interested in dropping into the Battlegrounds to know?\nJC: Players can sign up for a free two-month Stadia Pro trial to gain immediate access to PUBG. For new players, there’s no better time to drop in and play the game. For existing or returning players, I’d really recommend giving it a go. The technology around cloud gaming and Stadia still impresses me to this day. It’s amazing that you can play our game from a browser!\nLoad Comments',

      'text': "Tweet by William D'Angelo , posted 46 minutes ago / 204 Views\nD eveloper Larian Studios announced Baldur’s Gate III will launch for PC via Steam and Google Stadia in early access in August. However, it might get pushed back due to the ongoing impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nView the Baldur’s Gate III early access release windows announcement trailer\nGather your party, and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power.\nMysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a Mind Flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.\nFrom the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.\nChoose from a wide selection of D&D races and classes, or play as an origin character with a hand-crafted background. Adventure, loot, battle and romance as you journey through the Forgotten Realms and beyond. Play alone, and select your companions carefully, or as a party of up to four in multiplayer. An expansive original story\nAbducted, infected, lost. You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength. Caught in a conflict between devils, deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you will determine the fate of the Forgotten Realms together. Forged with the new Divinity 4.0 engine, Baldur’s Gate 3 gives you unprecedented freedom to explore, experiment, and interact with a world that reacts to your choices. A grand, cinematic narrative brings you closer to your characters than ever before, as you venture through our biggest world yet. No adventure will be the same\nThe Forgotten Realms are a vast, detailed and diverse world, and there are secrets to be discovered all around you -- verticality is a vital part of exploration. Sneak, dip, shove, climb, and jump as you journey from the depths of the Underdark to the glittering rooftops of the Upper City. How you survive, and the mark you leave on the world, is up to you. Key Features: Online multiplayer for up to four players allows you to combine your forces in combat, and split your party to follow your own quests and agendas. Concoct the perfect plan together… or introduce an element of chaos when your friends least expect it. Origin Characters offer a hand-crafted experience, each with their own unique traits, agenda, and outlook on the world. Their stories intersect with the entire narrative, and your choices will determine whether those stories end in redemption, salvation, domination, or many other outcomes. Evolved turn-based combat , based on the D&D 5e ruleset. Team-based initiative, advantage & disadvantage, and roll modifiers join combat cameras, expanded environmental interactions, and a new fluidity in combat that rewards strategy and foresight. Define the future of the Forgotten Realms through your choices, and the roll of the dice. No matter who you play, or what you roll, the world and its inhabitants will react to your story. Player-initiated turn-based mode allows you to pause the world around you at any time even outside of combat. Whether you see an opportunity for a tactical advantage before combat begins, want to pull off a heist with pin-point precision, or need to escape a fiendish trap. Split your party, prepare ambushes, sneak in the darkness -- create your own luck!\n ",

      'text': 'Go to Article\nWelcome back to This Week in Apps, the Extra Crunch series that recaps the latest OS news, the applications they support and the money that flows through it all.\nThe app industry is as hot as ever, with a record 204 billion downloads and $120 billion in consumer spending in 2019. People are now spending three hours and 40 minutes per day using apps, rivaling TV. Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a combined $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.\nIn this Extra Crunch series, we help you keep up with the latest news from the world of apps, delivered on a weekly basis.\nThis week, we’re looking at the mobile news from the events that didn’t happen this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. That includes the launch of Android 11 beta, which would have normally arrived during Google I/O, along with all the new Android developer tools. Snap also held its partner summit this week, where it announced a number of new Snapchat features, new partner relationships, and its plans for its AR ecosystem.\nNot to be left out, Apple stole a little attention this week with its reveal of the WWDC20 schedule. Like many others, Apple’s conference is going virtual for the first time. It’s even redesigning its forums to aid with Apple engineer-developer interactions.\nThis week in app trends, we examine data from new reports on COVID’s impact on home improvement apps and hypercasual gaming. Headlines\nAndroid 11 beta launches along with new developer tools\nAfter a series of delays and the cancellation of Google I/O, the Android 11 beta finally launched this week. This next major version of the Android OS is focused around three themes, says Google: People, Controls and Privacy.\nOn the People side, Android 11 gives conversation notifications a dedicated section at the top of the shade, offers a Bubbles API for messaging apps, improves Voice Access , adds new emoji and more. New consolidated keyboard suggestions allow Autofill apps and Input Method Editors (e.g., password managers and third-party keyboards), to now securely offer context-specific entries in the suggestion strip.\nNew device controls make it easier for users to access and control connected/smart home devices with a long press of the power button or access payment options. New media controls in an upcoming beta release will make it easier to switch the output device for audio or video content. ',

      'text': 'Microsoft Teams grid view limit What is Microsoft Teams?\nMicrosoft Teams is the tech giant’s foray into the world of video conferencing. Teams stands apart in the sea of video conferencing apps with its unique ‘Chanel’ feature that lets you build subgroups under the original ‘Team’.\nMicrosoft Teams is equipped with audio and video calling capabilities as you would expect from an app in the genre. However, what makes the app a perfect collaboration tool is its integration with other Microsoft products. Teams allows users to share and edit documents right within the app itself. It also has a cloud sync feature that lets you keep your documents available for download whenever necessary! Microsoft Teams user limit (participants)\nMicrosoft now allows all paid users to have up to 250 members on a video call. This has been recently increased from its 100 member limit, to help better compete with the likes of Zoom and Google Meet.\nFree users can only host video calls with up to 20 members. Microsoft Teams call time limit\nDepending on the type of meeting, Microsoft Teams has different time limits in place. These limits do not refer to the length of the video call, instead, when the meeting will expire. It should be noted, that Microsoft Teams does not mention a time limit on the length of a call. You can prevent a meeting from expiring by simply starting a new meeting or updating it.\nThe chart below explains the expiration date for each type of meeting and the length by which it can be extended if updated.

      'text': 'Home » National News » Federal appeals court clears… Federal appeals court clears way for Texas execution The Associated Press June 13, 2020, 11:49 AM Share This: Listen now to WTOP News WTOP.com | Alexa | Google Home | WTOP App | 103.5 FM\nBROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) — A federal appeals court has cleared the way for the execution to proceed next week of a man condemned for the fatal stabbing more than 20 years ago of an 85-year-old woman.\nRuben Gutierrez, 43, is scheduled to die Tuesday for the 1998 killing of Escolastica Harrison at her home in Brownsville, which is in Texas’ southern tip along the border with Mexico. Prosecutors said the killing was part of an attempt to steal more than $600,000 the woman had hidden in her home.\nA federal judge in Brownsville s tayed Gutierrez’s execution Tuesday after concluding he would likely succeed on at least one of his legal challenges. But a panel of three judges on the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court overturned that decision Friday.\nGutierrez’ attorneys have long sought DNA testing of evidence they say could save him, and the presence of a Christian chaplain in the execution chamber. The Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops has also filed a legal motion saying the state must provide Gutierrez access to clergy in the death chamber.\nThe Fifth Circuit panel ruled the issues at play in Gutierrez’s case have been sufficiently litigated in state and federal court and the district court “abused its discretion” in the staying execution.\nGutierrez’s attorney, Shawn Nolan, said his client will appeal the decision.\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice, by policy, prohibits all religious or spiritual advisors from entering the state death chamber for an execution.\nCopyright © 2020 The Associated Press.

      'title': 'Android 11 Operating System To Roll Out In Q4 Of 2020',
      'text': 'Want the low-down on the latest rides and gadgets? We have it all. Sign up to receive it.\nWith the release of a beta version, Google has revealed a little more of what to expect from Android 11 , which is due to roll out some time during Q4 of this year.\nThe latest update to the operating system, which was to be presented at the Google I/O Developer Conference that was unfortunately cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, Android 11 will have a lot to offer.\nThe initial beta does not have all of the features of Android 11, but there are nonetheless plenty of interesting functionalities to explore. One that looks to be very useful is Bubbles, a feature that allows you to pop out ongoing texting threads from any communications app into a bubble that floats over whatever else you might be doing. Also with a view to facilitating communication, notifications will now be grouped together for greater visibility, and also to enable you to respond more quickly if necessary.\nAnother headline feature in Android 11 is the new media player, which can control multiple music apps at the same time and makes it easy to switch from one output to another, allowing you to continue playing a song on your headphones, speakers or even your TV. With regard to home automation, it will also be possible to access devices connected to Google Home directly with a long press on the smartphone’s start button.\nTo speed up use of its virtual keyboard app, Gboard, Android 11 offers intelligent suggestions for text and emojis. There is also automatic initialisation of permissions for applications that have not been used for quite some time and a screen video capture tool.\nIt is important to note that this beta version can only be installed on Pixel smartphones (2nd generation or later). If you are the owner of one of these, you can try out the new features by registering for the Beta program and then launching an update of the operating system.',
