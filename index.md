### About me

<div class="row">
    <div class="column60" style ="padding: 0px;">
      <p style="text-align: left;">  <br> My name is <b>Tram Duong</b>. <br><br>
        I hold a Master of Science degree in Applied Analytics at Columbia University and a Bachelor Degree in Finance and Management Information Systems (MIS) at the University of Washington. <br><br>
        I have always enjoyed solving puzzles, and that is how I look at large and complex datasets. To me, they are more like big puzzles rather than business problems that I need to work on. It is always exciting to find patterns within different datasets and use my experience to solve them.<br><br>
        I am passionate about applying my technical and analytical skills, including my statistical and mathematical knowledge, to recognize business problems and develop effective business strategies across organizational functions.<br><br>

- <b>Skillful ability</b> with mathematics, statistics, and analytics. <br>

A sampling of my work can be found <b>[here](https://tramduong.github.io/portfolio/)</b>.

### Career Goal
<p class="justify">
  I enjoy the challenge of problem solving and have had a natural curiosity for computers for this very reason. I am passionate about the field of analytics as I love both science and problem solving. I have constantly sought ways of teaching myself knowledge regarding programming and software development to further my skills and knowledge. <br><br>

  I view data analytics as a field that can make a significant impact as so many modern businesses transform their work towards digital platforms and becoming data-driven. I believe that my interest and dedication to science and technology, as well as my understanding of the necessity of hard work in order to succeed, will be great assets to me in this challenging and exciting career path.
